- ✨ Fun fact: Before I started getting interested in programming, I was always a big fan of technology and how it has changed all of our lives. In 2020, with the pandemic, all the technology companies came to the fore and the contribution they made at such a difficult time for everyone, there my curiosity with programming expanded.           I started looking for information and learning in a self-taught way, I fell even more in love with this world, it is hard but beautiful at the same time, I feel how I grow with each challenge I find while I learn.            My path in the world of programming is just beginning, and I am excited to wait and see what the future holds for me in this career... ⚡


I'm 24 years old and my journey in this lovely challenging world is just beginning✨🤟🏽
